# EasyListApp
A Grocery List App For IOS that provides some interesting uses I didn't find to my liking in any free apps on the app store.

My main gripe with many of the free list based apps is that you often end up with many different lists that may need to be recreated everytime you go shopping for something, if you aren't someone who buys the same items every week.

My app provides a simple approach to creating one singular list, filled with any items you may ever want to buy. Each item can be tagged with as many custom tags as you like. Before going shopping, or whatever other use case you may have for a list, simply select all the items you desire. Easily click a button to only show selected items, then deselect as you go. With this flexible and simple design you will only need to enter an item a single time saving time and effort in the long run, and although your "master" list may get very long, it will be very easy to filter through and navigate.
